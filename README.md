# Synology (- or linux in general) - Remov _invalid file and directory chars - like Ææ Øø Åå Ôö etc 
Sometimes during certain operations local language characters can become corrupted, resulting in files and folders of the Synology NAS being inaccessible via DLNA, SMB or other types of shares. They can however still be accessed via SSH and renamed. If there are a lot of files, this script will come in handy. It can be run by pasting it in directly in the shell.
